    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>Permeability function and magnetic loss tangent of a medium composed of artificial magnetic material inclusions can be expressed in terms of the perimeter and area of an inclusion. This expression of the inclusion's magnetic response in terms of the geometric properties simplifies and facilitates the design process of the inclusion. Such new inclusion's circuit model creates flexibility and allows to the designer to achieve a specific constraints without the use of the intensive full wave electromagnetic simulation. In this paper, we apply a generalized model of the resonant behavior of an inclusion to study the nth order rose curve resonator (n-RCR) electromagnetic response. This study is based on a numerical and analytical simulation. A detailed parametric study on the transmission characteristics and the magnetic behavior of the n-RCR based on its physical and geometrical parameter is presented. The studied geometrical parameters are the perimeter, the area and the order of the rose curve resonator. Moreover, the width and the height of the printed conductor are defined as the principle physical parameters that will be analysed and investigated. Nth Rose curve resonator is a novel curve, considered as a generic candidate for the artificial magnetic materials and provides new characteristics not found in traditional resonators.</i></p>

    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">The
propagation of electromagnetic wave through a medium is controlled by the
medium's electric permittivity and magnetic permeability. Although the
permittivity and permeability are positive in natural materials at microwave
frequencies, metamaterials are artificial materials whose electromagnetic
properties can be engineered to be effectively negative. Artificial Magnetic
Materials (AMMs) are a type of metamaterials which exhibit magnetic material
properties not found in nature as previously shown (Pradeep et al., 2011). In
fact, the strong interest in such material lies in it being an enabling
technology in several key applications. These emergent applications are using
metamaterial blocks as a substrate for enhancing low-profile antenna
performance (Buell
et al., 2006), as a probe for near-field sensing (Boybay
et al., 2008), for shielding applications (Lovat et al., 2007) and microwave
absorbers (Bilotti et al., 2008) and many other applications.</p>

<p class="body">An ensemble
of metallic broken-loop resonators aligned in parallel planes normal to their
surface and in a host dielectric is considered as an AMM. The magnetic dipoles
generated in rings due to the magnetic field radiation are responsible for
effective magnetic response of the medium. Artificial Magnetic Material (AMM) consist
of metallic broken-loop inclusion which of incident magnetic field. Circular
split-ring resonators (SRRs) and Swiss Roll resonators (SRRs) are common form
of AMM's inclusions, originally purposed by Pendry et al. (1999). Split-ring
resonators (SRRs) consists of two rings which separated by a gap and having
splits on the opposite sides. The open metallic loop behaves as an LC resonator
as shown by Kabiri et al. (2010). The area of the inclusion corresponds to its
inductive behavior and its perimeter corresponds to the capacitive response.
The area and perimeter in SRRs are dependent resulting in the dependency of the
circuit-based equivalent capacitance and inductance of SRRs. Due to this
restricted geometrical characteristic of SRRs, they are not capable of
providing a full range of magnetic response; hence, limited to a random
uncontrollable magnetic response. To generate a specific magnetic response of
an AMM, the capacitance and inductance of inclusions needs to be tuned
independently as confirmed by Khan and Mughal (2009).</p>

<p class="body">Kabiri
et al. (2011) proposed a generic inclusion's geometry called <i>n<sup>th</sup></i>
order rose curve resonator (n-RCR) which provides a full control on design of a
desired magnetic response achievable by AMMs. RCRs are a generalized form of SRRs. The zeroth order RCR
geometry has a circular shape identical to SRR. However, higher order RCRs have
a circular base with a deformed sinusoidal perimeter providing extension to the
perimeter of the inclusion while keeping the area constant. By tuning the order
and amplitude of the deformation one can generate any desired magnetic
properties achievable by AMMs. In addition, different topologies of inclusions
have been proposed in the literature as proposed by Baena et al. (2004). RCRs
are also printed in these configurations similar to as of SRRs extending the
range of magnetic response of the composite AMM. Figure 1 shows different
configurations of the <i>n<sup>th</sup></i> order rose curve resonator. An edge-coupled
inclusion designed by 7th order Rose curve is presented in figure 1 (a). Figure
1 (b) (c) illustrates respectively abroad-side coupled inclusion designed by
7th order Rose curve and a spiral inclusion designed by 13th order Rose curve.</p>

</figure>

<p class="body">In this work,
we comprehensively study the magnetic response of an AMM composed of n-RCR based
on its multi design parameters. In fact, the characteristics of this new
inclusion are studied and analyzed to underscore the importance of this
resonator. We study the impact of the geometrical and physical parameters. In
fact, the impact of the order <i>n</i> on the permeability function and the
resonant frequency is detailed. In addition, the effect of the area and the
perimeter on the resonance frequency and the permeability is studied. As the
area and the perimeter are independently tuned by the geometrical parameter of
the rose, the effect of this parameter on the magnetic response of the <i>n<sup>th</sup></i>
RCR is also presented. Further parametric studies were carried out on the
effect of the physical parameters on the magnetic response of the rose curve
resonator.</p>

<p class="body">In the following sections, first the magnetic
response of the inclusion is modeled and explained. In fact, this
model is general and can be used for any shape of the inclusion. Then in Section
3, the nth rose curve resonator is presented. Next in Section 4, using
numerical full wave analysis, the magnetic response of the nth rose curve
resonator is revealed. Moreover, the simulations are performed for two
categories of the rose curve resonator (broad-side
coupled inclusion and edge-coupled inclusion). Finally in
Section 5, a parametric study is presented to characterize the magnetic
spectral response of metamaterials with unit cells of <i>7<sup>th</sup></i>
order rose curve configuration.</p>

<h4>2. Modelling Magnetic Response </h4>

<p class="body">In fact, it
has been proved by Kabiri et al that the physical response of inclusions in
AMMs in the presence of electromagnetic field is the same for different
inclusions' geometries (2011). Figure 2 illustrates a sample of a unit cell of
generic rose curve resonator. By periodically repeating this contour C in a
unit cell along a slab, a metamaterial block can be created. In figure 2, the
unit cell is defined by a width <i>&#916;x</i>, depth <i>&#916;z</i> and height
<i>&#916;y</i>. Therefore, the area and the volume of this unit cell are <i>A=
&#916;x&#916;z </i>and <i>V= &#916;x&#916;z&#916;y=A&#916;y</i>. In addition,
the area of the contour <i>C</i> is denoted by <i>s </i>and its perimeter is
denoted by <i>l</i>. The printed inclusion is made with a conductor material
defined by an electric conductivity of <i>&#963;</i>, height of <i>t</i> and
width of <i>b</i>. In fact, the resonator is made with two parallel conductor
separated with a uniform gap <i>g</i>. The permeability function and the
frequency response of the inclusion can be characterized using physical and
geometrical properties. As previously shown by kabiri et al. (2009), the
resultant permeability of the rose curve resonator can be formulated using
physical and geometrical parameters based on a circuit model as:</p>

<p class="body">Where <img src="IJECS_003_eqn_files/image002.png" class="eqn"> is the normalized frequency and <img src="IJECS_003_eqn_files/image003.png" class="eqn"> is the resonance frequency. <i>F </i>is the fractional area of the cell occupied by the interior of the inclusion and <i>P</i>
is a parameter that represents the physical characteristics of the inclusions
based on following equations:</p>

<p class="body"><i>L<sub>u</sub></i> is

the inclusion.</p>

different structure. </p>

<h4>3. N<sup>th</sup> Rose Curve Resonator</h4>

<p class="body">In this
section, the characteristics of the nth order RCRs are discussed. The inductive
and capacitive response of RCRs is disjointed by defining the geometry based on
multiple parameters. </p>

<p class="body">These curves
have a principal characteristic that the area and the perimeter of these rose
curves can be adjusted independently. The parameterization of rose curve can be
described in polar coordinates by the equation (6):</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="IJECS_003_eqn_files/image010.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(6)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">Where <i>r(&#952;)</i>
represents the position of an inclusion's contour in the polar coordinate, and <i>&#952;</i>
is the polar angle which sweeps the contour aside the slit. The parameters <i>r<sub>0
</sub></i>and <i>a</i> are constants and <i>n</i> is an integer representing
the order of the curve. Note that, due to its formulation, the area and the
perimeter of the rose curve can independently and controllably to be selected
in order to achieve enhanced or selected properties of the resonator. </p>

<p class="body">In their
work, Kabiri et al. (2011) has shown that the magnetic properties of the
metamaterials can be expressed as a function of the geometrical and the
physical properties of the inclusions. The perimeter and the area can be
considered as the principal geometrical properties of the inclusion. In the
structure of the nth order RCR, the area and the perimeter can be calculated
using the following expressions:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="IJECS_003_eqn_files/image011.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(7)</div>
</div>

<div class="equation">

</div>

<div class="equation">

<div class="eqn-number">(9)</div>
</div>

<div class="equation">
<img src="IJECS_003_eqn_files/image014.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(10)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">For a
specific value of area and perimeter, we can determine the geometrical
parameters <i>r<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>a</i> using the relations (7) and (8).
By defining <i>r<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>a</i>, any structure of the rose curve
resonator can be modelled and simulated using numerical
full wave analysis. Combining equation (9) and (10) and
solving relations (7) and (8)for the
specific area and perimeter of the inclusions obtained from a design procedure,
the parameters <i>a</i> and <i>r<sub>0</sub></i> are calculated for any order
of the Rose curve. The order of Rose curve determines the number of peaks and troughs
on the circle leading to a higher value of the curvature on the inclusion's
contour.</p>

<h4>4. Simulation of the Magnetic Response</h4>

<p class="body">To study the
characteristics of RCRs, we have simulated the rose curve resonator in the
various topology of broadside-coupled and edge-coupled structure. Figure 3
illustrates magnetic response of the broadside-coupled rose curve resonator
(BC-RCR) and the edged-coupled rose curve resonator (EC-RCR). These two
resonators are simulated using the same geometrical and physical parameters.
Table 1 summarizes the physical parameters of the traces and dimensions of
inclusions and it was used to perform the simulation setup. </p>

<p class="body">In the
simulation, a substrate with relative dielectric constant <i>&#949;<sub>r</sub></i>
of 2.2 is used (Rogers RT/duroid 5880 (tm)).The thickness of the metal used on
the simulation is noted <i>t </i>and it is equal to <i>t</i>= 35 &micro;m and the
traces are made with a copper characterized by an electrical conductivity equal
to 59.6 s/&micro;m. In fact, in order to simulate the effect of the geometrical
parameters on the permeability function, the trace width and the trace gap are
respectively fixed to 200 &micro;m and 700 &micro;m.</p>

<div class="widetable">

<p class="body">The effective
permeability of the rose curve resonator is determined from the physical
quantities of the reflection coefficient <i>S<sub>11</sub></i> and the
transmission coefficient <i>S<sub>21</sub></i>. The S-parameters of the unit
cell of this rose curve resonator and the position of the resulting resonant
frequency have been determined using a time varying electromagnetic field. </p>

<p class="body">In fact, the
S-parameters have been simulated with Ansoft HFSS. This full-wave
three-dimensional electromagnetic commercial software is used to perform the
numerical analysis of the effective parameters. </p>

Figure 3. The permeability function versus frequency
Broad-side coupled inclusion and Edge-coupled
inclusion designed by 7th Rose Curve.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">Then, using a
developed Matlab application, the Ansoft HFSS results have been converted to
desired parameters based on the extraction formula demonstrated by Smith et al
(2002) and calculated by Xudong et al (2004). Figure 3 shows the variation of
permeability function of the two structures of an RCR with the frequency. For
the same geometrical and physical parameters, the edged-coupled rose curve
resonator (EC-RCR) resonates at 2.7 GHz but the broadside-coupled rose curve resonator
(BC-RCR) resonates at 2.1 GHz. In fact, we can notice that the resonance
frequency of the BC-RCR is lower than the resonance frequency of the EC-RCR. </p>

<p class="body">A comparative
analysis of both EC-RCR and BC-RCR has been carried out. It has been found that
this second resonator shows a lower resonant frequency for the same physical
dimensions and permits to have an electrically smaller unit cells. The last
property is useful for designing discrete metamaterials with electrically small
unit cells. In
the following sections, the edged-coupled rose curve resonator
(EC-RCR) will be simulated and analysed. So, the
simulation will be limited to this structure.</p>



<h4>5. Parametric Study of The n<sup>th</sup> RCR</h4>

<p class="body">In this part,
the effect of the dimension cell, the area, the perimeter and the order of RCRs
on the magnetic response of the composite AMM are studied. Furthermore, the
impact of the physical characteristic on the permeability function is analysed.
This parametric study allows characterizing the n-RCR and can be used as a rule
guide for design of inclusions with desired magnetic properties.</p>

the permeability function increases from 65 to 140 when the dimension <i>&#916;y</i>
of the unit cell varies from 0.3mm to 0.8mm. </p>

<p class="body">In fact, the inductance
per unit area <i>L<sub>u</sub></i><sub> </sub>defined by equation (3) is a
function of the dimension cell <i>&#916;y </i>and also the permeability
function is expressed using unit cell dimension in equation (2). So, the
magnetic response of the nth rose curve resonator is very sensitive to the
substrate height.</p>


<p class="subhead"><i>5. 1.2.The Effect of the Area</i></p>

<p class="body">To study the
effect of the area on the resonant frequency and the permeability function
while the perimeter of the inclusion is fixed and the area is varied from 120mm<sup>2</sup>
to 200mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p class="body">The magnetic
response of the simulated RCR is presented in figure 6. In fact, the real part
of permeability function is negative near the resonance frequency. Figure 7
illustrates the variation of the resonance frequency versus the area. The
resonant frequency decreases from 1.25 GHz to 1.05 GHz while the area increases
from 120mm<sup>2</sup> to 200mm<sup>2</sup>. </p>

</figure>

<p class="body">However, the
maximum amplitude of the permeability function increases from 10 to 23 when the
area varies from 30% to 50% of the unit cell area. The area occupied by the
interior of the inclusions tunes the inductance of the inclusions. Hence, when
the area occupied by the inclusion increases the resonant frequency decreases.
In fact, by knowing the area occupied by the rose curve resonator, the designer
can determine the dimensions of the geometrical properties of the inclusion <i>r<sub>0
</sub></i>and <i>a</i>. So, for any predefined geometrical properties of the
inclusion, the designer can have an idea about the resonance frequency and the
magnetic response of the rose curve resonator.</p>

<p class="subhead"><i>5. 1. 3. The Effect of the Perimeter</i></p>

the <i>7<sup>th</sup></i> rose curve resonator is simulated for different
values of perimeter when the area is fixed to 150mm<sup>2</sup>. </p>

<p class="body">Figure 8
illustrates the frequency response of the permeability functions for different
value of the perimeter varied from <i>P</i>=65mm to <i>P</i>=70mm. We observe
that the resonant frequency and the maximum amplitude of the permeability
function decreases when the perimeter increases. The resonance frequency varies
from 0.94 GHz to 0.84 GHz when the perimeter increases. </p>

</figure>

<p class="body">Furthermore,
the maximum amplitude of permeability function decreases from 11 to 9. In fact,
the effect of the perimeter on the resonant frequency and the maximum amplitude
of the permeability function are presented in the figure 9. The capacitive
response of an inclusion is tuned by its perimeter geometry. Therefore, the
resonant frequency and the permeability decrease while the trace length
increases. It can be noticed that inclusion with larger perimeter resonates at
lower frequencies.</p>



<p class="subhead"><i>5. 1.4.The Effect of the Order <i>n</i></i></p>

<p class="body">The responses
of the inclusions of different orders with identical <i>r<sub>0</sub></i> and <i>a</i>
are very similar in shape. Figure 10 demonstrates the resonant frequency and
maximum amplitude of the permeability function versus the order of inclusions.</p>

<p class="body">The resonance
frequency varies from 0.9 GHz to 0.74 GHz when the order increases from 7 to
13. In fact, higher order rose curve resonators introduce the higher coupling
factor. In figure 11, we present the variation of the resonance frequency and
the maximum amplitude of the permeability. </p>

<p class="body">In fact,
increase in order of inclusions decreases the resonant frequency of the
inclusions leading to a higher miniaturization of the AMM structure. This
enhancement is due to the increase in perimeter length and new capacitive and
inductive coupling between the adjacent segments of the rose curve resonator.</p>



<p class="subhead">5. 2. Physical Properties of the nth RCR</p>

<p class="subhead"><i>5. 2. 1. The Effect of the Trace Width</i></p>

<p class="body">Physical
properties are variables that are controlled by the designer and the
fabrication techniques. The width and height of the printed conductor can be
defined as the principle physical parameters that affect the magnetic response
of the resonator. </p>

<figcaption>
Figure 12. Comparing the permeability versus frequency of n-RCR with different value of b.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">We can also mention
the space between parallel printed lines, and material characteristics such as
conductivity of the conductor. To study the effect of the physical properties
of the inclusion, we simulate
the magnetic response of the rose curve resonator. Figure 12 shows the variation
of the permeability function versus the frequency from 0.4GHz to 0.6. In
fact, the resonance frequency decreases from 0.6 GHz to 0.4 GHz when the values
of trace width <i>b</i> increase from 0.2mm to 0.8mm. </p>

<p class="body">Nevertheless,
the amplitude of the permeability function increases from a value of 60 to 200
as the trace width varies from 0.2mm to 0.8mm. We have proved previously that
the permeability function was highly sensitive to the physical parameters of
the inclusions. Since, the total capacitance and the total resistance of the
inclusion are a function of the trace width, the permeability function rapidly varies
with the variation of the trace width. Figure 13 illustrates the evolution of
the resonance frequency and the maximum amplitude of the permeability with the
variation of trace width of the inclusion.</p>

<p class="body">In
this part, the effect of the trace gap between the two parallel metal contours
of the inclusion is studied. In fact, we analyze the magnetic response of the
rose curve resonator between 0.2GHz and 0.8GHz. </p>

<p class="body">Figure 14
shows the variation of the permeability function versus the frequency for
different value of the trace gap noted <i>g</i>. Moreover,
both the resonance frequency and the permeability function increase when the
values of trace gap g increase. We have earlier noticed that the magnetic
response of the inclusion can be considered as a function of the physical
parameters of the inclusions. In fact, the total capacitance of the inclusion
is a function of the trace gap. Consequently, the resonance frequency varies
from 0.4GHz to 0.6GHz with the variation of the trace gap. Similarly, with the
variation of the trace gap, the amplitude of the permeability varies from 54 to
66. Figure 15 shows the evolution of the resonance frequency and the maximum
amplitude of the permeability with the variation of trace gap of the inclusion.</p>

<h4>6. Conclusion</h4>

<p class="body">The magnetic
behavior of the nth order rose curve resonator (n-RCR) has comprehensively
investigated. Using numerical and analytical simulation, this resonator was
modeled and studied. A parametric study was performed based on the geometrical and
physical characteristics of n-RCR. The area and perimeter and the order of the
RCRs are considered as the main parameter of the geometric study. Furthermore,
the physical parameters of the trace are used to characterize the spectral
magnetic behaviour of the inclusion. It has been observed that the resonant
frequency and the permeability function are very sensitive to the area, the
circumference and the order of the rose curve resonator. Also, the impact of
the physical properties on the permeability function is underscored. In fact, the
study can facilitate the design process of rose curve resonators. Moreover, the
method performed in parametric study can be utilized in design n-RCRs used as
inclusions of an artificial magnetic material with predefined magnetic response.</p>
