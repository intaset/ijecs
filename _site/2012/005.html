    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>This paper presents an aspect-based approach for realizing a transformation from platform-independent to platform-dependent models in the context of a model transformation chain that generates queueing-based performance models from UML design models of service-oriented applications. The purpose of generating such performance models is to evaluate the performance of the system under development in the early software lifecycle phases, in order to insure that it will meet the performance requirements. The paper presents the model transformation chain PUMA4SOA, which transforms automatically a UML model of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) system extended with MARTE performance annotations into an intermediate model, Core Scenario Model (CSM), which in turn is used to generate a Layered Queueing Network (LQN) performance model. Aspect-oriented modeling is used to represent different services offered by the underlying SOA platform to the SOA application. The paper discusses and compares different alternatives for composing the platform aspect models with the platform-independent model (PIM) of the application throughout the model transformation chain.</i></p>

    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body">Service-Oriented
Architecture (SOA) is a software architectural approach that seeks to develop
and deploy business applications as a set of reusable services (Earl, 2005).
The developers of SOA applications would benefit from the ability to estimate
the performance of the proposed design (in terms of response time, throughput
and utilizations) in the early development phases, as promoted by the Software
Performance Engineering methodology (Smith, 1990). This requires deriving (by
hand or automatically) a performance model from the software design model and
deployment information. In the case of UML designs, performance annotations are
added to the software model with the help of the MARTE profile, standardized by
OMG (OMG, 2009). An example of a model transformation chain which takes as
input a UML software design model with performance annotations and generates
automatically various types of performance models (such as queueing networks,
Petri nets, simulation, etc.) is called PUMA - Performance for Unified Modeling
Analysis (Woodside et al., 2005). The authors of this paper, who were also
contributors to PUMA, have proposed an extension called PUMA4SOA (Alhaj and
Petriu, 2010), which adds new capabilities for evaluating the performance of
SOA systems. The main differences between PUMA and PUMA4SOA stem from the kind
of design models taken as input and the separation between the Platform-Independent
Model (PIM) of the SOA application, and the Platform-Specific Model (PSM) which
incorporates platform details needed for performance evaluation. We account for
platform effects similar to (Selic, 2008), considering that the underlying
platform offers a set of services or operations to the applications running on
top of it. This allows for the rapid composition of a given PIM with multiple
platform models, which allows us to evaluate its performance for different
platforms. </p>

<p class="body">This paper focuses on
modeling as aspects the platform operations details required for performance
analysis and considers alternate ways for composing the aspects with the
application model. This paper extends a previous conference paper (Alhaj and
Petriu, 2012) with a performance-completion feature model for representing the variability
in the service platform, an approach for composing multiple aspects, a
description of aspect composition at CSM level and a section on performance
analysis using the LQN model.</p>

<p class="body">The paper considers
three alternative approaches for composing the aspects model representing
platform operation with the application PIM, as shown in Figures 1, 9 and 12
and discussed later in the paper. In Figure 1, the starting point of<i> </i>PUMA4SOA
is the UML design model with MARTE annotations, which includes three parts: 1) <i>application
PIM</i>, 2) <i>deployment diagram</i>, and 3) <i>platform aspect models</i>.
The application PIM represents the software design using three views: a) <i>workflow
model</i> describing the business process, b) <i>service architecture model</i>
representing the hierarchy of underlying services, and c) <i>service behaviour
models </i>representing the execution steps of the invoked services. The
deployment diagram describes the allocation of software artifacts to
processors, needed for the performance model derivation.</p>

</figure>

<p class="body">A feature model called
Performance Completion (PC) feature model represents the choices in platform
characteristics, as described in section 2. Platform aspect models represent
the structure and behaviour of different service platform (such as service
invocation and service discovery) in a generic form. A recent OMG standard
profile SOA Modeling Language (SoaML) (OMG, 2012) is also used to express the
service architecture model. SoaML extends UML with the ability to define the
service structure, behaviour, dependencies, and capabilities.</p>

<p class="body"><i>Aspect oriented modeling</i>(AOM) is
used to generate the platform specific model (PSM) by weaving platform aspect
models into different locations in PIM. In principle, AOM uses two types of
models: the <i>primary model</i>, which is the core design model, and a set of <i>aspect
models</i> describing concerns that crosscut the primary model. Aspect <i>composition</i>
(a.k.a. <i>weaving</i>) in AOM is performed in a number of steps: 1) defining
the <i>point cut</i> rules (a set of conditions applied to the primary model to
identify the join points), 2) identifying the <i>join points</i> (i.e.,
location in the primary model where an aspect composition occurs), 3)
instantiating a <i>context-specific aspect model</i>, by binding the parametric
values of the <i>generic aspect</i> to concrete values related to the context
of the join point in the primary model, and 4) performing the <i>aspect
composition</i> at the join points (France et al., 2004), (Woodside et al,
2009).</p>

<p class="body">After obtaining the PSM,
a model transformation is performed to generate the <i>Core Scenario Model
(CSM)</i>. CSM is an intermediate language which aims to bridge the semantic
gap between the software and performance domains during the model
transformations (Petriu and Woodside, 2007). CSM reduces the complexity of
mapping different views from design model to the performance model and helps
checking the consistency of the generated models. The CSM is then transformed
to one of different types of performance models, such as Layered Queuing
Network (LQN) (Woodside et al., 2005), which is solved to produce the
performance results of the system.</p>

<p class="body">PUMA4SOA provides the
ability to transform PIM to PSM based on the AOM approach at three modeling
levels: UML, CSM and LQN. Although the platform aspect models are originally
defined in UML, they can be transformed separately and composed into the
primary model at different levels, i.e. UML (Fig. 1), CSM (Fig. 9), and LQN
(Fig.12) as discussed in the paper. </p>

<p class="body">The paper is organized
as follows: Section 2 introduces the concept of performance completion feature
model; Section 3 describes the UML input models, illustrated with a Purchase Order
system example; Section 4 presents and compares the aspect composition at the
UML, CSM and LQN levels; Section 5 describes the approach for performing
multiple aspect compositions; Section 6 discusses the performance results of
the case study; Section 7 presents related work and Section 8 the conclusion
and directions for future work.</p>

<h4>2. Performance Completion Feature Model</h4>

<p class="body">PUMA4SOA uses a
so-called <i>Performance Completion (PC) feature model</i> to represent the
variability in service platform which may affect the system's performance. PC
feature model provides the choice to select between multiple platform
characteristics (each represented by aspects) based on the business
requirements. The concept of "performance completions" was introduced by (Woodside
et al., 2002) to close the gap between abstract design models and external
platform factors. It was also used in (Happe et. al, 2010) and (Tawhid and
Petriu, 2011) to define the variability in platform choices, execution
environments, types of platform realizations and other external factors which
have impact on the systems performance. A feature model is normally represented
using feature modeling notations and grammars, such as the one introduced in
(Batory, 2005). However, in order to maintain the model consistency with the
UML input design models (PIM, Deployment diagram and Aspect models), we use a UML
class diagram extended with stereotypes to represent the PC feature model. </p>

<p class="body">The term
&quot;feature&quot; was introduced in (Kang et al., 1990) and defined as a
&quot;prominent or distinctive user-visible aspect, quality, or characteristic
of a software system&quot;. In PUMA4SOA, the PC feature model represents a classification
of different SOA platform characteristics and their relationship in a
hierarchical format. The developer can select from the PC feature model those
platform features needed for the application, according to the system
requirements. (Please note that in our work, we build and aspect model for each
feature, so the selection of a certain feature implies the selection of an
aspect).</p>

<p class="body">The root class, which represents
the service platform is decomposed into a set of feature groups, some mandatory
and others optional. A feature group holds in turn a set of features, which may
have sub-features. The relationships between a feature and its sub-features can
be categorized as: </p>

<ol>
<li><i>Mandatory</i>:
represented as a solid circle, used when a feature group or a feature is
required;</li>

<li><i>Optional:</i>
represented as non-solid circle, used when a feature group or a feature is
optional.</li>

<li><i>Or:</i>
represented as a solid arc, used when at least one of the feature groups or features
must be selected. </li>

<li><i>Alternative
(XOR):</i> represented as a non-solid arc, used when one of the feature groups
or features must be selected.</li>
</ol>

<p class="body">In addition to the
relationships between parents and child nodes, cross-tree feature constraints
are allowed. For instance, "A requires B" means that the selection of A implies
the selection of B.</p>

<p class="body">Fig. 2 shows the PC
feature model used for the Purchase Order system example presented in the next
sections. There are three mandatory feature groups which are required: <i>Operation,
Message Protocol</i>, and <i>Realization</i>, and two optional feature groups: <i>Communication</i>
and <i>Data Compression</i>. The relationships between the feature groups and
their features are all alternative (XOR) with exactly-one-of feature selected. Although the
dependencies between the sub-features are not shown in the model, some features, such as <i>Operation, Message Protocol</i>
and <i>Realization</i> are dependent. For example selecting one of the<i> Operation</i>
sub-features, such as <i>Invocation</i>, requires also selecting one of the
message protocols (Http or SOAP) and one of the realizations (WebService, REST,
etc.).</p>

<h4>3. Example of PUMA4SOA Input
Model: Purchase Order System</h4>

<p class="body">PUMA4SOA begins with
developing the Platform independent model (PIM). The top level model is the business
workflow model represented as UML activity diagram(s). Fig. 3 illustrates the
workflow of a simple purchase order system. The workflow starts when the sales
server receives the purchase order (PO), followed by the parallel processing of
invoice and scheduling activities, and then by the <i>ShipProduct</i> activity.
An AD partition marked with the MARTE stereotype <i>PaRTimeInstance
</i>indicates the runtime process/component responsible for the execution of
the respective activities  in this case, the workflow <i>POProcess</i>. The
stereotype <i>GaWorkloadEvent </i>indicates that a closed workload is
associated to this business process, with a number of simultaneous users (i.e.,
population) expressed by the MARTE variable <i>Nusers</i>; each user has a
think time of 3000 ms, given by the attribute <i>extDelay</i>. </p>

<p class="body">Fig. 4 illustrates the
service architecture model expressed with the help of SoaML stereotypes to
define the participants, their binding rules and their capabilities. Components
stereotyped as <i>Participant</i> indicate parties that provide or consume
services. Ports are stereotyped with <i>Request</i> to indicate the
consumption of a service, or with <i>Service</i> to indicate the offered
service. </p>

Figure 5. PIM: Service Behavior model.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">The details of each
activity in the workflow model from Fig. 3 are described in a refined service
behaviour model. However due to the space limitations, only <i>Ship Product</i>
activity is presented in Fig. 5. The shadowed area indicates the invocation by <i>Sales</i>
of the <i>SetShippingDate</i> service offered by the component <i>Shipping, </i>which
uses a data management instance to store the data on a disk server. From a
performance point of view, a UML behaviour model drawn as an activity or
sequence diagram can be considered that it represents a Scenario composed of
Steps related by predecessor-successor relationships (sequence, branch, merge,
fork, join, etc.). MARTE has two kinds of step stereotypes: <i>PaStep</i>
representing the execution of an activity or an operation invoked by a message
and <i>PaCommStep </i>for the communication costs involved with passing a
message between components. Examples of <i>PaStep </i>attributes are <i>hostDemand</i>
giving the value and unit for the step execution time and <i>prob</i> giving
the probability for the optional steps. An example of
<i>PaCommStep </i>attribute is <i>msgSize</i> giving the size and unit. </p>

<p class="body">For performance
modelling we need also a deployment diagram as in Fig. 6, which shows the
allocation of active software components (indicated with the MARTE stereotype <i>SchedulableResource</i>)
to the hardware nodes (<i>GaExecHost </i>and <i>GaCommHost</i>). </p>

<p class="body">A platform aspect model
describes the structure and behaviour of a platform operation in a generic
format. In this paper, the SOA platform is in fact the middleware used for
service invocation, discovery, publishing, etc. Each middleware operation is
represented by a different aspect model which has multiple views. Fig. 7a illustrates
the generic deployment diagram and Fig. 7b the sequence diagram of the service
invocation aspect model. </p>

<p class="body">The aspect models are
defined independently of the SOA application with which they will be composed,
so generic parameters are used. As a naming convention, the vertical bar |
indicates a generic role name (France et al., 2004). For example, the |<i>client</i>
component acts as service consumer, while the |<i>provider</i> component as service
provider. The middleware on both sides defines two generic roles: the |<i>xmlParser</i>
which helps to parse and marshal/unmarshal data and the |<i>SOAP</i> stub for sending/receiving
messages using the SOAP protocol.</p>

<h4>4. PIM to PSM Transformation</h4>

<p class="subhead">4.1 Aspect Composition at the UML Level</p>

<p class="body"> Fig. 1 shows the alternative
where the aspect composition takes place in the UML design model. The models
described in Fig. 3 to Fig. 6 represent the purchase order system in UML extended
with MARTE and SoaML stereotypes. In our example, the primary model is the
platform independent model (PIM) in Figs 3, 4 and 5, while the
platform aspect model represents the generic structure and behaviour of the platform
operation service invocation in Figs. 7a and 7b. </p>

<p class="body">The first step in the
AOM approach is to define the point cut rules. Since our example aspect (i.e., service
invocation) applies only to SOA services, the point cut rule must be able to locate
the service calls in the primary model. In the case of Service Invocation, we
are looking for a UML element of type <i>Message</i> in a service behaviour
model that calls a service stereotyped <i>Service </i>in the architecture
model. (In our example, there are four services identified in Fig. 4).</p>

<figcaption>Figure 7. Platform aspect model for Service invocation</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">The next step looks for
the join points (i.e., the places in the model where to weave the aspects) by applying
the point cut rules to PIM. The result of this step will identify all the
messages in behaviour models that represent service calls. For instance, the
highlighted message <i>SetShippingDate</i> in Fig. 5 is one of the join points.</p>

<p class="body">Once the join points are
identified, a context specific aspect model is generated by instantiating the
generic aspect model for each join point. The instantiation requires binding
the generic roles to concrete ones from the scope of the join point, and then
assigning context specific performance values to <i>PaStep </i>attributes (processing
demands, probabilities, etc.). Table 1 illustrates a sample of binding of
generic roles to concrete values: some to existing PIM roles and some to newly created
roles (for example, XML parsers and SOAP processing). Table 2 illustrate a
sample of the binding of generic performance parameters represented by MARTE
variables assigned to stereotype attributes. The context specific aspect model
is not shown here due to the space limitations; however it will appear within
the composed model in Fig. 8.</p>

<p class="body">The final step in AOM is
to weave (i.e., compose) the context specific aspect model within PIM at the
join point location. Fig. 8 shows a composed model, where the <i>SetShippingDate
</i>message<i> </i>(join point) has been replaced with the context specific
aspect model (the gray area).</p>



<p class="subhead">4.2. Aspect Composition
at the CSM Level</p>

<p class="body">CSM is focused on modeling
scenarios, which are implicit in many software specifications. The CSM
metamodel describes three main types of concepts: resources, scenarios, and
workloads. A scenario is a graph of steps with precedence relationships. A step
may represent a basic operation or be refined as a sub-scenario. There are four
kinds of resources in CSM: <i>Processing Resource</i>, <i>ComponentResource</i>,
<i>LogicalResource</i> and external resource. </p>

<p class="body">PUMA4SOA provides the
flexibility to perform the aspect composition at the CSM level, as shown in Fig.
9. The platform independent model (PIM) and the platform aspect model are first
transformed into CSM models separately. Fig 10 presents a subset of the scenarios that constitute
the CSM model of the Purchase Order system PIM: the top-level scenario and the
refinement of the composed step <i>Ship Product</i>. The UML workflow model is
transformed into the CSM top scenario model, whose activities are in turn
refined by CSM sub-scenarios obtained by the transformation of the service
behaviour model interaction diagrams into CSM.</p>

<p class="body">The procedure
for the aspect composition in CSM form Fig. 9 is similar to the one in UML. However,
the point cuts rules cannot be defined exclusively at the CSM level, because
the details of the service architecture model at the UML level is not entirely transformed
to CSM. CSM is scenario-based and its metamodel mainly captures the details of
the behaviour models, while many of the details of the structure models are
lost during the transformation. This is one of the major drawbacks of
performing aspect composition at the CSM level. To solve this issue, we need to
go back to the UML level in order to use the service architecture model for identifying
the services of the PO system, then to identify the steps in the CSM model that
correspond to service invocations. </p>

<p class="body">After identifying the
join points in CSM, we need to instantiate the context specific aspect model.
The generic roles are bound to concrete ones, similar to the UML composition,
and the performance variables are assigned concrete values. The generic roles in
a CSM scenario are used in <i>ResourceAcquire</i> or <i>ResourceRelease</i> steps,
which describe the acquisition and releasing of a generic resource. Table 1 and Table 2 describe
the binding of the generic roles and parameters to the concrete ones for our
example. </p>

<p class="body">Aspect composition is
the last step, done by weaving the context specific aspect model in the PIM. At
CSM level, the weaving requires replacing the join point steps, the preceding <i>ResourceAcquire</i>
and the succeeding <i>ResourceRelease</i> with the context-specific aspect.

the aspect composition in CSM can be found in (Woodside et al., 2009) and
(Alhaj, 2008). </p>



<p class="subhead">4.3. Aspect Composition
at the LQN Level</p>

<p class="body">The LQN model is an
extended queueing network model which is able to represent nested services
(Woodside et al., 1995). An LQN model is an acyclic graph of nodes called
tasks that offer services called entries (see Fig.13). The entries of a
task may request services from the entries of other tasks (the requests are
represented as directed arcs). LQN is used to model several types of system
behaviour and inter-process communication styles. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IJECS_005_files/image009.png" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 12. PUMA4SOA approach: Aspect composition at LQN level.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">Tasks represent both
software and hardware devices, and allow for multi-threading and nested
services. An entry may contain a graph of activities, as in Fig. 13.
Graphically, the software tasks are represented with thick rectangles and the
entries with attached thin rectangles. The hardware devices are represented as
ellipses. </p>

<p class="body">PUMA4SOA allows for
performing the AOM aspect composition at the LQN level (see Fig. 12). The CSM
of PIM and the generic CSM of the platform aspect model are first transformed
into LQN models separately. Fig. 13 represents the LQN model of the platform-independent
PO model. The workflow layer, which represents the CSM top scenario model, is
transformed into a top level LQN activity graph associated with a task called <i>POProcess</i>
allocated on <i>SalesHost</i>. The service layer, corresponding to CSM
sub-scenario models that describe the services, is transformed into a set of
tasks with their owned entries. Fig. 14 illustrates a simplified LQN of the
generic platform aspect model, where the steps performed by the XML parser and
the SOAP stubs in the middleware model have been aggregated. (More details are
given in (Alhaj and Petriu, 2010). The
|<i>Client</i> and |<i>Provider</i> tasks own a <i>client</i> and <i>service</i>
entries, respectively. The middleware on the |<i>Client</i> side (|<i>MW1</i>)
owns a <i>send</i> entry which sends the service request, and the |<i>Provider</i>
side (|<i>MW2</i>) owns a <i>receive</i> entry which receives the service
request. The network delay suffered by the message is modeled by the delay
entry of the |<i>net</i> task. </p>

<p class="body">The procedure for aspect
composition in LQN is similar to the ones for UML and CSM levels. However, since
the LQN metamodel is different, the point cut rules and join points are defined
with different model elements. Note that the drawback of CSM regarding the loss
of service details has been propagated to the LQN level. The LQN point cut rule
for Service Invocation checking for a request arc from a client which
is requesting an entry that corresponds to a service. Note that, by
construction, an entry providing a service has the same name as the service.</p>

<p class="body">The next phase is instantiating
the context-specific aspect model from the generic one, which is similar to the
step performed at the UML level, where the generic roles defined in the LQN
model in Fig. 14 are bound to concrete ones. The final phase is performing the
aspect composition at the join points. In our Purchase Order example, we
composed the context specific aspect model of the service invocation of <i>SetSchedulingDate</i>
by adding new tasks with entries to the LQN, which model the middleware for all
components and the network delay. The result of aspect composition in LQN is
illustrated in Fig. 15 (the LQN tasks and entries that represent the platform
are shaded in gray).</p>

<p class="subhead">4.4. Comparison between Composition Alternatives</p>

<p class="body">As already mentioned, PUMA4SOA
provides the flexibility of transforming a platform independent model to a platform
specific model based on aspect composition at three levels: UML, CSM and LQN.
This allows the modelers to select between different odelling languages and to
perform the AOM aspect composition based on their needs.</p>

<p class="body">The main advantage of
performing aspect composition in UML stems from the language features. UML is
an OMG standard odelling language. It is popular, supported by several
model-driven tools and represents the software model which is well understood
by software developers. </p>

<p class="body">We also noticed that we
were able to define easily the point cut rules in UML, whereas it is more
complicated in CSM and LQN. The reason is that some of the SOA-related information,
which is present in the UML model, gets lost in the transformation to CSM and to
LQN, which are more abstract models. Another advantage of performing aspect
composition in UML is the ability to modify models with changing requirements,
which cannot be done as easily in CSM or LQN directly; any model change must
start from UML, in order to keep the consistency between software and
performance model throughout the transformation chain. </p>

<p class="body">However, the UML aspect
models have usually multiple views (structural and behavioural) represented by
different diagrams, so the composition should take place in all these views.
This complicates not only the composition, but the effort of maintaining all
the views of the composed system consistent. Besides, the composed models are
more complex and may become harder to be understood by the developers. </p>

<p class="body">On the other hand, CSM
and LQN both have a lightweight metamodel compared with UML and a single view
for each model. This advantage makes the implementation of the aspect
composition simpler in CSM and LQN. It is significantly easier to insure the composition
consistency and to reduce the execution time required for the model
transformation in PUMA4SOA. Table 3 summarizes the points of comparison between
the three levels of platform aspect composition.</p>

<h4>5. Multiple Aspect Composition in PUMA4SOA</h4>

<p class="body">As described by the PC
feature models in Section 2, a service platform is characterized by many
features. In our work, each platform feature corresponds to an aspect model. PUMA4SOA
provides the ability to perform multiple service platform aspect compositions. From
the hierarchy of service platform aspects defined in the PC feature model, the developers
are able to select as many aspects as needed for the application according to
the requirements. The generic UML models of the selected aspects are extracted
from a predefined library. This library contains structural and behavioural
representations for every service platform aspect in a generic form, as
described in section 4.1. </p>

<figure>
<img src="IJECS_005_files/image014.png" class="article-img">
</figure>

<p class="body">In the multiple
aspect composition process, a chain of individual aspect compositions is
performed, where each composition may depend on others within the chain. The
cause of the dependency comes from the fact that the selected aspects are woven
into the same primary model, which means that they share the same context model
elements, i.e. same concrete roles and parameters. Moreover, in some cases <i>nested
compositions </i>are required,<i> </i>where the result of weaving a preceding
aspect may act as a primary model for a succeeding one. Due to the
dependencies between the aspect compositions, ordering the chain of individual
aspect composition is critical. </p>

<p class="body">In the PO system
example, the goal of aspect compo-sition is to generate the platform specific
model by weaving the service invocation aspect into the PIM. Assume that a new aspect
is selected from the PC feature model, such as message security, which aims to
secure all messages which are sent through public networks. To secure the
message exchange that corresponds to service invocations in the PO system, the Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) protocol can be used(Freier et al, 2011). SSL is normally
used for web-based secure transactions; it handles mutual or one one-way
authentication and preserves the integrity of the data exchange between the
client and the server. Fig. 16a illustrates the generic deployment
diagram and Fig. 16b the sequence diagram of a simplified SSL protocol aspect
model (Freier et al, 2011).</p>

<p class="body">The behaviour of the SSL
protocol has two phases: 1) the handshake phase, where both the client and the server
authenticate each other, and 2) the transfer phase, where the message exchange
takes place, with the encryption of the data before the transfer and the
decryption of the data on the other side. This is a case of nested composition,
where the invocation aspect is woven first and the security aspect second.</p>

<p class="body">Aspect composition is
performed by following the same AOM procedure described in the previous
sections. For simplicity, we will perform aspect composition at the UML level.
In defining the point cut rule, we are looking for all UML elements of type <i>Message</i>
in the service behaviour model stereotyped with <i>PaCommStep</i>, whose
sender and receiver are allocated on different nodes. The second step is
identifying the join points by applying the point cut condition to the primary
model. The result will identify all the join points; one of them is <i>RequestSOAPMessage</i>
in the <i>Ship Product</i>
sequence diagram shown in Fig 8. The context-specific aspect models are then
generated by instantiating the generic aspect model of the SSL protocol by
binding the generic roles and formal parameters to concrete values. Table 4 illustrates
the binding of generic roles in this case.</p>

<h4>6. Performance Analysis</h4>

<p class="body">In this section, we give
a brief example of performance analysis for the Purchase Order system. The main
purpose of the performance analysis is to find the performance bottleneck (i.e.
software or hardware components that saturate first and throttle the system). After
identifying the bottleneck, we apply a series of hardware and/or software
modifications to mitigate the bottleneck and to improve the response time and
the throughput of the overall system. </p>

<p class="body">Fig. 15 represents the
LQN model generated for the PO system (the aspect composition of SSL protocol
is not included). An existing LQN solver is used to solve the model and to produce
task service times (including waiting for nested services), queueing delays,
processor utilizations, response times and throughputs. The results are used to
identify the performance hotspots in the system.</p>

<p class="body">The results of the performance
analysis, shown in Fig. 18 represent the response time and throughput of the
system in function of the number of users ranging from 1 to 100. We analyzed
several configurations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Initial:
the base case where the multiplicity of all tasks and hosts is 1. The Sales task
is the software bottleneck. To mitigate the bottleneck, we increase the
multiplicity of Sales task.</li>

<li>A:
The bottleneck is resolved by increasing the multithreading of the Sales task
to 15, so that multiple requests can be served concurrently. The response time
is reduced by 55% (with respect to the initial), and moves the bottleneck to
the Invoicing task.</li>

<li>B:
The bottleneck is resolved by increasing the multithreading of the Invoicing to
5. The response time is reduced by 49% (with respect to A), and moves the
bottleneck to Disk host, and disk server.</li>

<li>C:
the bottleneck is resolved by increasing the multiplicity of the disk host to
4, and increase the multithreading of the disk server to 3.</li>
</ul>

<p class="body">The performance analysis
results show that the response time has been reduced by 90%, and throughput
improved by 60% compared to the base configuration (initial). </p>

<p class="body"> Another example
of performance analysis for a SOA system is given in (Alhaj, 2011), where the
trade-off between service granularity and system performance is investigated. </p>



<h4>7. Related Work</h4>

<p class="body">This section
presents a brief overview of related works. In the past decade, OMG has
standardized two UML profiles that extend UML for the real-time domain: the
UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance and Time (SPT) defined for UML
1.X, and the UML Profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded
systems (MARTE) (OMG, 2009) defined for UML 2.X. Both SPT and MARTE include
their own performance subprofiles, which allow annotating UML models of real
time systems with quantitative resource demands and other information required
for performance analysis. The standardization efforts on the one hand and the emergence
of Model-Driven Architecture on the other hand, have triggered a lot of
research on the automatic derivation of different kinds of performance models
from annotated software models, as surveyed in (Cortellessa et al, 2011).</p>

<p class="body">A popular realization
of SOA systems is based on Web Services; therefore there is interest in modeling
and analyzing the performance of such systems. As Web Services use the SOAP
protocol, which is XML-based and introduces performance overheads, the
performance impact of different SOAP implementations was investigated in (Gomez-Martnez
and Merseguer, 2006). Other research on building performance models for web
services takes a two-layered user/provider approach in (Marzolla and Mirandola,
2007): the user is a set of workflows and the provider a set of services
deployed on a physical system; the queueing network formalism is used to derive
performance bounds. In (DAmbrogio and Bocciarelli, 2007), performance
information about service capabilities and invocation mechanisms is given by
the means of P-WSDL (Performance-enabled WSDL). </p>

<p class="body">An approach
to model platform operations, called <i>performance completions</i> is
presented in (Happe et al., 2010).
Such completions abstract from platform-specific details and can be
instantiated for different target environments using measurements of a
test-driver designed especially for a parametric performance completions.
Performance completions close the gap between available high-level models and
required low-level ones. </p>

<p class="body">Reusable
Aspect Models (RAM) is a scalable approach to multi-view aspect-oriented
modeling presented in (Kienzle et.al., 2010). RAM allows the modeler to define
stand-alone reusable aspect models that support the modeling of structure
(using UML class diagrams) and behavior (using UML state and sequence
diagrams). RAM supports aspect dependency chains, which allows an aspect
providing complex functionality to reuse the functionality provided by other
aspects. The paper (Xu et al., 2007) presents an aspect-based modeling
approach for web service composition using UML. The approach was motivated by weaknesses
of the current composite specification, such as BPEL. In (Abu-Eid,
2007)
it is presented an aspect oriented approach which aims to make the process of
applying features to web services more flexible and less resource consuming.
The approach introduced an aspect oriented extension module which modularizes
the logic of applied features. In (Feng et al., 2009), a requirement-driven
aspect oriented approach for web service composition (WSC) is proposed. In this
approach, the level of abstraction of evolution modeling for web services
composition has been elevated from business process level to strategic goal
level. However, none of the AOM approaches targets platform modeling like in
our case. </p>



<h4>8. Conclusions </h4>

<p class="body">The paper focuses on the
ability of PUMA4SOA to transform the Platform Independent Model (PIM) of SOA
systems into Platform-Specific Model (PSM) by using AOM. PUMA4SOA is a model
transformation framework which aims to generate performance models from
different design models of SOA systems. It provides the flexibility to perform aspect
composition at three levels: UML, CSM and LQN. Although the aspect composition follows
similar steps, the degree of composition complexity differs between the three
levels, especially between UML and the other two. The complexity depends on the
size of the respective language metamodel. A comparison has been done to present
the pros and cons of performing aspect composition at the three levels. The
main points of comparison are related to language features complexity of the metamodels,
implementation complexity of aspect composition, etc. </p>

<p class="body"> The paper
also discussed the ability of PUMA4SOA to perform multiple aspect compositions by
selecting multiple aspects from the PC feature model and then applying a chain
of aspect compositions. The dependency between aspect compositions was a major concern,
since the order of aspect composition is importance. The dependencies between
service platform aspects can be defined by using the relationships defined in
the PC feature model, and by using a constraint language, such as the OCL
language, to define which aspects can be used together and in which order. The
relationship and dependencies between the service platform aspects will be part
of our future work, </p>

<p class="body">We have implemented
aspect composition in CSM (Alhaj, 2008) but not in UML or LQN. We are integrating
CSM composition in the PUMA4SOA. We are planning to define other aspects for
SOA platform services (such as discovery, publishing, subscription, and message
security) and to study their influence on the performance of SOA systems.</p>
